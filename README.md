The idea for Happy Hops was to create a sleek, simple, and streamlined app for people to visit while bar hopping in Chicago. A user who happens to be strolling around in a neighborhood in chicago can log into our app and ask for bars that are located in the neighborhood they are in. The app would have solved the issue of having to scroll through google results which overwhelms you with results.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

begin by downloading the code with 
### `git clone https://github.com/kryan39/HappyHops360`

before you run the app, you must download npm, a package manager for javascript
### `npm install`

now you are free to use Happy Hops.
